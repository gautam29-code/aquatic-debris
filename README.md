EFFICIENT PREDICTION OF AQUATIC DEBRIS IN OCEAN SURFACES USING MACHINE LEARNING

introduction 
Every year, tons of plastic and other garbage are either pushed into the aquatic environments or left on the beaches or disposed of or abandoned. 
Not only does the garbage look unpleasant but also poses a threat to the economy and the environment. 
Accumulation of trash in aquatic environment leads to ecosystem destruction of marine life and poses a long-term threat to the environment. 
Marine debris can last for a long period of time. Debris is pieces of rubbish or unwanted material that are spread around. 
Marine debris is defined as solid man-made material that can be directly (from ship or ocean platform), indirectly (from storm drains, etc.), purposefully dumped or accidentally abandoned into our aquatic environment or the Great Lakes.
